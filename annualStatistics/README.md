Annual Statistics
=================

This folder contains the statistics that are generated annually to support the Dryad Annual Report. 

About the download counts: Dryad tracks downloads of individual files, but for the purpose of this report, the counts are at the level of data packages. We compute the number of downloads for a package by using the *maximum* number of downloads for any individual file within the package. This method of calculation ensures that the counts are independent of the number of files within a data package, and independent of whether multiple small files are combined into a larger compressed files.
