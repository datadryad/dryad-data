Annual Statistics
=================

This folder contains the statistics that are generated annually to
support the Dryad Annual Report. Note that the files are cumulative;
each file contains information on all data packages that were in the
repository at the end of the respective year.

About the download counts: 
- Dryad tracks downloads of individual files, but for the purpose of
  this report, the counts are at the level of data packages. We compute
  the number of downloads for a package by using the *maximum* number of
  downloads for any individual file within the package. This method of
  calculation ensures that the counts are independent of the number of
  files within a data package, and independent of whether multiple small
  files are combined into a larger compressed files. 
- Download counts in this report are cumulative, representing all
  downloads since a package was first published.
- Package size is in bytes. It includes the sum of sizes for all data 
  files in the package, excluding the size of any metadata.
